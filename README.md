# LVC: Large Language Models and Prompt Engineering

This project focuses on exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) and the role of Prompt Engineering in enhancing their performance. It aims to provide insights, tools, and resources for researchers and developers working with large language models, with a specific emphasis on prompt-based approaches.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained prominence in natural language processing tasks. This project, LVC-3, focuses on understanding, experimenting, and providing resources related to LLMs, especially in the context of prompt engineering. It explores how carefully crafted prompts can enhance the capabilities of these models in various applications.
